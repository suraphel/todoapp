				Unfortunately, the world of programming doesn’t really fall into four cleanly separated
				parts. Therefore, the “parts” of this book provide only a coarse classification of
				topics. We consider it a useful classification (obviously, or we wouldn’t have used it),
				but reality has a way of escaping neat classifications. For example, we need to use
				input operations far sooner than we can give a thorough explanation of C++ standard I/O
				streams (input/output streams). Where the set of topics needed to present an idea
				conflicts with the overall classification, we explain the minimum needed for a good
				presentation, rather than just referring to the complete explanation elsewhere. Rigid
				classifications work much better for manuals than for tutorials.
