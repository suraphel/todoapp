				Thanks to the reviewers that Addison-Wesley found for me. Their comments, mostly based
				on teaching either C++ or Computer Science 101 at the college level, have been
				invaluable: Richard Enbody, David Gustafson, Ron McCarty, and K. Narayanaswamy. Also
				thanks to my editor, Peter Gordon, for many useful comments and (not least) for his
				patience. I’m very grateful to the production team assembled by Addison-Wesley; they
				added much to the quality of the book: Linda Begley (proofreader), Kim Arney
				(compositor), Rob Mauhar (illustrator), Julie Nahil (production editor), and Barbara
				Wood (copy editor). Thanks to the translators of the first edition, who found many
				problems and helped clarify many points. In particular, Loïc Joly and Michel Michaud did
				a thorough technical review of the French translation that led to many improvements. I
				would also like to thank Brian Kernighan and Doug McIlroy for setting a very high
				standard for writing about programming, and Dennis Ritchie and Kristen Nygaard for
				providing valuable lessons in practical language design.
